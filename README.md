This repo are a set of tests created by the test-first-teaching
organization. [Learn more about them on their website] (http://testfirst.org)
It provides a basic ruby class to run tests on.

Reflection:
Having learned Object-Oriented Programming with Python in
university made these exercises fairly routine. Most of the
difficulty came from learn Ruby syntax for classes and blocks.
